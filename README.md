# 4-Bit ALU in Verilog

This project implements a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in Verilog HDL. The ALU supports basic arithmetic and logical operations and includes a testbench for simulation.

## Features
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Bitwise AND, OR, XOR
- Bitwise NOT
- Logical Left Shift and Right Shift

## Files
- `ALU_4bit.v`: Verilog code for the ALU
- `ALU_4bit_tb.v`: Testbench for the ALU
